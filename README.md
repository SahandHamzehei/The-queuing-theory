# Analyzing the Network System Performance Based on the Queuing Theory Concept

## Introduction
With the expansion of network use across multiple domains, optimization has become increasingly paramount. This research delves into understanding network performance using the Queuing theory. The primary aim is to pinpoint an optimal network design, considering server count and distribution, to enhance packet transmission and reduce packet loss.

## Abstract
The Queuing theory provides insights into the network's performance by examining various factors, aiming to determine the best design based on server numbers and distribution. The main objective is to heighten packet transmission rates while minimizing packet loss. The study's findings highlight the benefits of a uniform service time distribution over an exponential one, indicating a decrease in packet loss. Moreover, the study showcases the packet transmission behavior across servers with different waiting line capacities. Comprehensive comparisons between M/M/l, M/M/l/B, and M/M/l/B queuing models are made to identify the best configuration for transmitting packets within the network.

## Key Insights
- Uniform service time distribution is more efficient in reducing packet loss than exponential distribution.
- The study offers an in-depth comparison between the M/M/l, M/M/l/B, and M/M/l/B queuing models.
- Behavior of packet transmission is elucidated for servers with distinct waiting line capacities.
